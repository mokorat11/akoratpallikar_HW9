a. Description
This project is a four-page Business Analytics Student Survey web form, created for Homework 9 in Digital Product Management. The form collects student background and academic info and ends with a thank-you page.

b. Best Practices
The form follows design best practices such as using clear labels, grouping related fields, ensuring inputs are keyboard accessible, and providing tooltips for additional help. I also used required attributes to reduce user error and added a thank-you confirmation screen. Bootstrap 5.3 was utilized for consistent spacing and responsive design, which ensures mobile friendliness. Font Awesome icons help improve user engagement and visual hierarchy.

c. Accessibility
To ensure that my web form is accessible to all users and meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines, I implemented several best practices across all four pages. I used semantic HTML5 elements with properly associated label tags to support screen readers, and applied Bootstrap 5.3’s built-in styling to maintain sufficient color contrast and provide visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation. All form inputs are fully accessible by keyboard, and I included tooltips using Bootstrap’s JavaScript-powered tooltip component to offer additional context where needed. Required fields utilize native HTML5 validation, which delivers accessible error messages. The layout is responsive and mobile-friendly, ensuring compatibility with various devices and assistive technologies. All of these practices combined support a smooth, intuitive, and inclusive experience for all users.
